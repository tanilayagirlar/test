    <p>1. Historical: The Boys in the Boat, Daniel Brown
This fabulously written non-fiction tells the story of the nine American boys who fought for gold at the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, Germany. It paints a vivid picture of the life of each member of the crew, focusing on their journey through the University of Washington through to the Olympic Games. It is intertwined with the story of Hitlerâ€™s rise to power and the unprecedented actions of the Nazis in the lead-up to the 1936 Games. The Boys in the Boat is one of the most popular rowing books of all time.</p>
